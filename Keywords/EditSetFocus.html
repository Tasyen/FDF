</head>
<body>
<h2>EditSetFocus</h2>
<p>Format: EditSetFocus,</p>
<p>Purpose: Gives this Frame focus when it is created. The focus given that way is quite strong clicking on the ground does not transfer focus nor does hiding it, But clicking onto another custom UI took it away and the focus became normal.</p>
<p>Used in: EDITBOX, GLUEEDITBOX, SLASHCHATBOX</p>
